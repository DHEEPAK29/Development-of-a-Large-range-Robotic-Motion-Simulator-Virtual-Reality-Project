# Development-of-a-Large-range-Robotic-Motion-Simulator-Virtual-Reality-Project

Dev of a controller that drives vehicles and ensures stability. 

Employed Adaptive Learning Algorithms:  

In the training process, AI is capable of exploring the performance metrics and offer the requisite learning programs. This then guarantees that simulators meet the specific needs of the individual users, thus improving their learning curriculum.

Applications:  

Skill-Based Training: 
 AI measures the user’s effectiveness, and determines if there are any issues such as slow reaction time or lost coordination.  
 Example: Thus, in a combat training simulator AI adapts the behaviour of simulated opponents to the level of the trainee.  

Feedback and Improvement:  
 Simulators provide immediate feedback in the form of visual and sound image feedback besides being able to correct the users’ mistakes.  
 Example: A driving simulator may caution a trainee on issues to do with wrong lane changes or bad braking habits.
