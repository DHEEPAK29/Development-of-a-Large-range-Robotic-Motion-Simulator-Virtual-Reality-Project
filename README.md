# Development-of-a-Large-range-Robotic-Motion-Simulator-Virtual-Reality-Project

Dev of a controller that drives vehicles and ensures stability. 

Software Layer of a Motion Simulator:  
To allow the right communication between the game and the motor, we employ both the game and SimTools. It coordinates the motors’ movements and is the sender and receiver of requests; in other words, SimTools is an interface. The SOLO Uno drive is integrated to SimTools via a plugin interface which was designed and jointly written by the authors of both the SOLO Team and the SimTools Team.  
Note: It is even possible to do a multiple axis racing set up in SimTools with the specified SOLO units and actuators for a 6DOF system.

Employed Adaptive Learning Algorithms:  

In the training process, AI is capable of exploring the performance metrics and offer the requisite learning programs. This then guarantees that simulators meet the specific needs of the individual users, thus improving their learning curriculum.

Applications:  

Skill-Based Training: 
 AI measures the user’s effectiveness, and determines if there are any issues such as slow reaction time or lost coordination.  
 Example: Thus, in a combat training simulator AI adapts the behaviour of simulated opponents to the level of the trainee.  

Feedback and Improvement:  
 Simulators provide immediate feedback in the form of visual and sound image feedback besides being able to correct the users’ mistakes.  
 Example: A driving simulator may caution a trainee on issues to do with wrong lane changes or bad braking habits.
